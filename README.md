 I decided I wanted to make a game. It was a goal I had when leaving uni.... that was 13 years ago!

 The goal:
 - Create a game
 - Focus on building a gaming engine... something that works
 - The game will be a platform game
 - It will all be my own code... it won't use any libraries (although techniques will be researched online)
 - HTML5 chosen as development platform. This following a training course at work where some chap said it was the future.
 - Target platform is Apple iPad, however game should work on PC brower and smartphones
 - Game should have 10 levels
 - Focus is on something that works... not fancy graphics... not fancy sound (cos I can't do that!)
